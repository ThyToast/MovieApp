This movie app demonstrates my interpretation of Android development best practices based on the requirements provided.


This app demonstrates:
- A native Android application running **Kotlin**.
- Integration of **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture using **Android Jetpack** libraries.
- Dependency Injection using **Dagger + Hilt**.
- A simple unit test using **JUnit4**.

## Overview
The diagram below is a diagram representation of the application.
